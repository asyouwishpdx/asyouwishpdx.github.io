                    <p>The Boucher Room is named In honor of Francois Boucher, my Great-Uncle who was a famous French Painter in the Rococo Art Movement.  His Niece, my Mother, has her art group meet here every Tuesday morning at 10:00 AM.  Daylight fills the room and makes the comfy window seat very inviting.  Large enough for a group of 12 seated adults.</p>
